 <p> The first challange of this week was to Design an 3D ORIGINAL .stl file to use in the MDX404 
 and then mill the part using subtractive manufacturing using the MDX40A (in wax). I used rose file
 that I found on thingaverse. The hardest part of this was making sure the design was deep enough so 
 that the chocoloate would come out solid enough. Also the milling of my design took like two days
  because it was so deteailed. Then after I had to crate a silcon casting. After that I was able to
  poor chocolate into and eat it!
