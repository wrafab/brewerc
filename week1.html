<p>The first week we did a challange one working with bases. The task was to build a steady base using some straws, a cup, and some tape.
  There were many ideas, but my main idea was to make the base triangluar. No on listened to me and majority voted on attempting 
  to make the cup hang. Because of this we got last place! So when we tried to test how many pennies our cup could hold, 
  we failed. Surprisingly we got one penny, which I did not think we would get. We came for revenege on the next group challange 
 (not pictured because we forgot). We got second to last place by making sure our marble safly got to the target, while also getting
  a nice distance away from it.
