<p> This week our class began learning and mastering Fusion 360. I watched a lot of youtube videos and read a lot of blog post
to be able to even understand Fusion360. But after I did my homework I got to work on the task. 
The task was to create a wax stamp seal. I decided that I wanted my wax stamp steal to be different, so within the star 
 I added a small ciricle. But the problem with it is that the circle is way too deep, so instead of leaving a circle within a
 a star on wax, there was like a nice star but with a huge hole on the inside of it missing. But overall it was good because this
 was my first time using a 3D printer, and also my first time using Fusion 360.
