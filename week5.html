<p> Our options this week included designing and printing a small 3D object that could not be made subtractively.For this
  task I decided to do this in Fusion360. I inserted a text box, and extruded the letter reall far. I did not have time to print 
  it before break but hopefully it comes out great.

  <p> For the other task we were told to make a drip irrgation system. This means a gadget that can twist onto a water bottle 
   which can then be put in the ground. I decided to go with a circular type gadget. In the screenshot above I show my gadget,
   but in it i clearly forgot to add the threads in Fusion360.But luckly I ran out of time before break to print it, so before
    I do when break ends I will have to add the correct sized threads so that i can properly screw it on to a plastic water bottle.
