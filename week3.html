<p>This week we used the machine that desgins shirts, I found a desgin on the internet and used photoshop to
take away the background. This weeek we used GDIP to postiion our design. 
In the  gdip I put the design on the shirt too high, which caused for half of the desgin to not be compelted. We were also
challanged to make a golf ball( which I plan on giving to my dad) but I do not have any pictures of me working on the 
golfball because Gerber thought it would be better to do everyone in the classes all at once. But I did have to edit my image
of me and my dad to make sure that it didn't fit weird on the ball. I had to crop it circular so that it would lay flat on the ball
