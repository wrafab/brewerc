<p> My final project idea was really cool and it super worked. The genreal idea was that I wanted
  to make my own lamp with led lights. The first stage was to cut up some bright color piping. The
  second stage was create a flat base. I used a square peice of wood, and round the corners so that it
  looked nicer. Then I had to create holes in the wood that were the right size as the piping. The right
  size as in big enough to fit and small enough to make sure the poles wouldn't slip out. The third stage
  was to appeal to the aesthic side of the project. I did multple layers of spray spaint so that
  each would show through and create a really nice color. The fourth stage was to raster some words or 
  designs on my pipes. I went with the names of my two brothers, 'Javier' and "Elisha', and I also 
  engraved the word family. The fifth stage which was the hardest was to saudert the LED lights for my 
  lamp. On the LED strip of lights I had to smake sure i saudert the correct parts so that I could get the 
  correct color, which is blue. After sauderting my LED lights I had to go back to my wood base and create 
  channels on the bottom connecting the holes so that the wiring would go through and the base could lay
  flat. And then finally I wrapped a peice of cloth around the top to give it a nice hippie vibe.
